# io-extras

Extra IO functions for Haskell.  Neil Mitchell's very useful
[extra](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/extra) library already
uses the module name `System.IO.Extra`, so I include my surname into
the module name.

**Warning:** this library is very unstable and its API may radically
change.
